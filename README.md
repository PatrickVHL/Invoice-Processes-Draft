# Invoice-Processes-Draft

This is a work-in-progress repository of the Technical Working Group of the
NPa, with contributions from service providers.

This repository contains several draft documents related to the
invoice-to-payment process, mainly regarding response document types, such
as the Message Level Response (MLR) and the Invoice Response Message (IRM),
sometimes referred to as the Business Level Response (BLR).

Please note that these documents are in a very early stage, and are far
from complete.

This also goes for the list of documents themselves: they may be merged or
split up in the future, and documents may be added or removed.

## List of current drafts

The list of current drafts is as follows:

Document | Description |
---------|-------------|
[Briefing](Briefing/Briefing.md) | A one-pager describing why response messages are important, and questions for the working group |
[Invoice to Payment Process](Invoice_to_Payment_Process/Invoice_to_Payment_Process.md)| A full descriptive document of the potential scenarios in the invoicing process, and when to use which response document |
[Proposed Solution for Invoice Response Messages](Invoice_Response_Message/Invoice_Response_Message.md) | Specific information on the form and contents of the Invoice Response Message (IRM)

## The Mermaid extension for markdown/github

Some of the documents contain diagrams. These are stored in plain-text which can be processed by the mermaid extension. In order to view these diagrams directly on github, you can install the Mermaid add-on for your browser.

Below is a list of links, but we advise you to search for it directly from the addon/extension store of your browser.

Browser | Extension
--------|-----------|
Firefox | https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/github-mermaid/
Chrome | https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-%20-mermaid/goiiopgdnkogdbjmncgedmgpoajilohe
Opera | https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/extensions-for-mermaid/

Instructions on how to use mermaid locally will be added later.
